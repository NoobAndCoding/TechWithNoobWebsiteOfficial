This is a web application for a channel on youtube called "TechWithNoob".

I made this with a pythong framework called "Flask".
It was written by me, "TechWithNoob" and maintained either from my contributor team or myself.
The application will be hosted on a platform called "render" on a domain that's probably gonna be "techwithnoobofficial.onrender.com" on a free method.
The server will be located in the EU, I think germany.
